Dear [Manager],

I wanted to reach out to you to express my sincerest apologies for not completing the regulatory trainings that were due recently. As you may be aware, I have been heavily focused on the LIDO Migration project and was completely packed until the deadline for training completion. Unfortunately, I was also on a block leave during the deadline dates and did not have the opportunity to complete the trainings before the deadline.

I understand that these trainings are critical in nature and any failure to complete them can have negative impacts on my overall performance rating. I deeply regret not being able to prioritize these trainings and assure you that it was not intentional.

However, I understand the importance of these trainings and made sure to complete them as soon as I returned from my leave. I have attached proof of completion for your review.

I understand if there are any repercussions for not meeting the deadline and am willing to accept them. I will make sure to prioritize these trainings in the future and ensure that I complete them on time.

Again, I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate your understanding.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
